      <p>
        The fundamental building block for linear algebra is the <span class="highlight">vector</span>,
        so let's talk about why it's so important.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img1.svg" alt="A vector drawn as an arrow in a coordinate grid" />
        <p class="image-caption">A vector in a coordinate grid</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        There are three primary interpretations of vectors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The physics student perspective</li>
        <li>The mathematician's perspective</li>
        <li>The computer science perspective</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Obviously we're only really concerned with the computer science perspective, but we'll
        briefly touch on the other two so you won't get caught off guard in a technical discussion.
      </p>

      <!-- SECTION: Interpretations -->
      <h2>Interpretations of Vectors</h2>

      <h3>Physics Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        The physics student perspective is that vectors are
        <span class="highlight">arrows pointing in space.</span> A given vector is defined by its
        <span class="highlight">length</span> and the
        <span class="highlight">direction</span> it's pointing, but as long as those two facts
        remain the same, you can move it around and it's still the same vector.
      </p>

        <img src="images/img2.svg" alt="Three perspectives on vectors: physics, CS, and math" />
        <p class="image-caption">The physics perspective: vectors are arrows in space</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Below is a visualization showing how 2D vectors differ from 3D vectors:
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img3.png" alt="2D and 3D vectors side by side" />
        <p class="image-caption">2D vectors live in a plane; 3D vectors live in space</p>
      </div>

      <h3>CS Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        The computer science perspective is that vectors are
        <span class="highlight">ordered lists of numbers.</span>
        For example, if you're comparing LLMs and the only features you care about are price (per million tokens) and context window size, you might model each LLM as a pair of numbers:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$\begin{bmatrix} \$3.00/\text{M tokens} \\ 128{,}000\;\text{ctx} \end{bmatrix}$$
      </div>

      <p>
        Look familiar? That's because "vector" is really just a fancy word for "list." Since there are two entries, it's a <span class="highlight">two-dimensional vector.</span> One last thing to remember is that
        <span class="highlight">order does matter here.</span>
      </p>

      <h3>Mathematician's Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        The mathematician's perspective is that a vector is anything you can
        <span class="highlight">add</span> and <span class="highlight">scale</span> in a
        well-behaved way. This matters to us because it's exactly what lets you perform
        arithmetic operations on lists and have the results still make sense.
      </p>

        <p class="image-caption">The mathematician's view: vectors are anything you can add and scale</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Coordinates -->
      <h2>Thinking About Coordinate Systems</h2>

      <p>
        While many of you are already familiar with coordinate systems, it's worth walking through them
        again to prepare for what's to come. In two dimensions, you have a horizontal line
        called the <em>x-axis</em> and a vertical line called the <em>y-axis</em>.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img5.svg" alt="The x-axis and y-axis" />
        <p class="image-caption">The x-axis and y-axis</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The place where they intersect is the <span class="highlight">origin,</span> which you should think
        of as the center of space and the root of all vectors.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img6.svg" alt="The origin where the axes intersect" />
        <p class="image-caption">The origin: center of space</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        After choosing an arbitrary distance to represent a length of $1$, you make tick marks on each
        axis spaced out by this distance.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img7.svg" alt="Tick marks on the axes" />
        <p class="image-caption">Tick marks define the unit length</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        When we want to convey the idea of 2D space as a whole, we extend these tick marks to make
        grid lines:
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img8.svg" alt="A full coordinate grid" />
        <p class="image-caption">The full coordinate grid</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Let's establish a specific thought to have in mind when we say the word "vector." Given the geometric focus here, whenever we introduce a new topic involving vectors, think about
        an <span class="highlight">arrow inside a coordinate system</span>, with its tail sitting at the origin.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img9.svg" alt="A vector as an arrow from the origin" />
        <p class="image-caption">A vector as an arrow rooted at the origin</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The <span class="highlight">coordinates</span> of a vector are a pair of numbers that give instructions for how to get from the
        tail of the vector (at the origin) to its tip. The first number and second number correspond
        to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis respectively.
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
          \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
          \text{walk } x \text{ units along } x\text{, then } y \text{ units along } y.$$
      </div>

      <p>
        To distinguish vectors from points, the convention is to write this pair of numbers vertically
        with square brackets around them. <span class="highlight">Every pair of numbers gives you one and only one vector, and every vector is associated with one and only one pair of numbers.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img10.svg" alt="Vector coordinates showing the walk from origin to tip" />
        <p class="image-caption">Coordinates as walking instructions</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In three dimensions, you add a third axis called the $z$-axis, which is perpendicular to both
        the $x$ and $y$ axes. Each vector is then associated with a list of three numbers:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}$$
      </div>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img11.svg" alt="3D coordinate system with a vector triplet" />
        <p class="image-caption">3D vectors use three coordinates</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Operations -->
      <h2>Vector Operations</h2>
      <p>
        Every topic in linear algebra centers around two operations:
        <span class="highlight">vector addition</span> and
        <span class="highlight">scalar multiplication.</span>
        Luckily, both are relatively straightforward.
      </p>

      <!-- Addition -->
      <h3>Addition</h3>
      <p>
        Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing up and a little to the right, and another
        pointing to the right and a little bit down.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img12.svg" alt="Two vectors before addition" />
        <p class="image-caption">Two vectors ready to be added</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        To add these two vectors, move the second vector so that its tail sits on the tip of the first one. Then draw a new vector from the tail of the first to where the tip of the second
        now sits. That new vector is their <span class="highlight">sum.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img13.svg" alt="Tip-to-tail vector addition" />
        <p class="image-caption">Vector addition: tip-to-tail</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        This works because each vector represents a movement or step with a certain distance and direction. The example below shows two steps of $2$ and $5$ that add up to the total distance traveled of $7$.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img14.svg" alt="Number line addition analogy" />
        <p class="image-caption">Addition on a number line: same idea, one dimension</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In general, vector addition means matching up terms and adding them together:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix}
          = \begin{bmatrix} x_1+x_2 \\ y_1+y_2 \end{bmatrix}$$
      </div>

      <!-- Scaling -->
      <h3>Scaling</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">The other fundamental vector operation is multiplication by a number.</span> If you take the number $2$ and multiply it by a given vector, you stretch that vector so that it's twice as long as it was before.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img17.svg" alt="Scaling a vector by 2" />
        <p class="image-caption">Scaling by $2$: the vector doubles in length</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you multiply a vector by $\frac{1}{3}$, you squish it down so that it's one-third its original length. If you multiply by a negative number like $-1.5$, the vector gets flipped
        around, then stretched out by a factor of $1.5$.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img18.svg" alt="Scaling a vector by one-third" />
        <p class="image-caption">Scaling by $\frac{1}{3}$: the vector shrinks</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        This process of stretching, squishing, and sometimes reversing direction is called <span class="highlight">"scaling."</span> The number you are multiplying the vector by is called the <span class="highlight">"scalar."</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Numerically speaking, scaling multiplies each component:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$c\,\mathbf{v} = c\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
          = \begin{bmatrix} cx \\ cy \end{bmatrix}$$
      </div>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$\frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 12 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}
          = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$$
      </div>

      <p>
        This will come up later in more detail when we discuss <span class="highlight">dot products.</span>
      </p>

      <!-- CONCLUSION -->
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Whether you think of vectors as arrows or lists of numbers, the main thing to remember is that they give us a structured way to represent and transform data. The two main ways we transform this data are <span class="highlight">vector addition and scalar multiplication.</span>
