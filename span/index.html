      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img1.svg" alt="Recap of vector coordinates as pairs of numbers" />
        <p class="image-caption">Vectors described by coordinate pairs</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now it's possible that vector coordinates were already familiar to you, but there's another interesting way to think about them. When you have a pair of numbers meant to describe a vector, like $(3, -2)$, you can think of each coordinate as a <span class="highlight">scalar.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img2.svg" alt="Vector coordinates interpreted as scalars" />
        <p class="image-caption">Each coordinate is a scalar that stretches or squishes</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the $xy$-coordinate system, there are two special vectors. The one pointing to the right with length $1$, commonly called <span class="highlight">"i-hat" $\hat{\imath}$, or "the unit vector in the $x$-direction."</span> The other one is pointing straight up with length $1$, commonly called <span class="highlight">"j-hat" $\hat{\jmath}$, or "the unit vector in the $y$-direction."</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img3.svg" alt="Unit vectors i-hat and j-hat" />
        <p class="image-caption">The unit vectors $\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{\jmath}$</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now, think of the $x$-coordinate as a scalar that scales $\hat{\imath}$, stretching it by a factor of $3$, and the $y$-coordinate as a scalar that scales $\hat{\jmath}$, flipping it and stretching it by a factor of $2$. In this sense, <span class="highlight">the vector that these coordinates describe is the sum of two scaled vectors.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img4.svg" alt="Vector as sum of scaled unit vectors" />
        <p class="image-caption">The vector $(3, -2)$ as $3\hat{\imath} + (-2)\hat{\jmath}$</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Those two vectors $\hat{\imath}$ and $\hat{\jmath}$ have a special name: together they are called the <span class="highlight">basis</span> of the coordinate system. What this means is that when you think about coordinates as scalars, the basis vectors are what those scalars actually scale.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img5.svg" alt="Coordinates as scalars of basis vectors" />
        <p class="image-caption">Coordinates are scalars applied to the basis vectors</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        There's also a more technical definition of basis, but we'll get to that later. Framing our familiar coordinate system in terms of these two special basis vectors raises an interesting and subtle point: <span class="highlight">we could choose a different pair of basis vectors and get a perfectly reasonable new coordinate system.</span>
      </p>

      <!-- SECTION: Choosing Different Basis Vectors -->
      <h2>Choosing Different Basis Vectors</h2>

      <p>
        For example, take some vector pointing up and to the right, along with a vector pointing down and to the right.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img6.svg" alt="Two non-standard basis vectors" />
        <p class="image-caption">A different pair of basis vectors</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now think about all the different vectors you can make by picking two scalars, scaling each basis vector, and adding them up. How many could you create?
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img7.svg" alt="Span example with different basis, first combination" />
        <p class="image-caption">One linear combination of the new basis</p>
      </div>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img8.svg" alt="Span example with different basis, second combination" />
        <p class="image-caption">Another linear combination of the new basis</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <span class="highlight">It turns out you can make <em>every</em> possible two-dimensional vector this way,</span> and it's a good puzzle to think about why. A different pair of basis vectors still gives you a valid way to go back and forth between numbers and vectors, but the mapping changes. The same vector in space gets <em>different</em> coordinates depending on which basis you use:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$\begin{bmatrix}-0.8\\1.3\end{bmatrix} \neq \begin{bmatrix}3.1\\-2.9\end{bmatrix}$$
      </div>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img9.svg" alt="Same vector, different coordinates under different bases" />
        <p class="image-caption">The same vector gets different coordinates under a different basis</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The takeaway: <span class="highlight">coordinates are only meaningful relative to a particular basis.</span> Change the basis, change the numbers.
      </p>

      <!-- SECTION: Linear Combinations -->
      <h2>Linear Combinations</h2>

      <p>
        Any time you're scaling two vectors and adding them like this, it's called a <span class="highlight">linear combination</span> of those two vectors.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img10.svg" alt="Linear combination with description" />
        <p class="image-caption">A linear combination: scale then add</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Why "linear"? When you multiply every real number by a vector, <span class="highlight">the result is a line through the origin.</span> Each vector defines its own line.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img11.svg" alt="Scalar multiplication produces lines through the origin" />
        <p class="image-caption">Each vector defines a line through the origin</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        A linear combination of two vectors is just a way of combining these two lines. For most pairs of vectors, if you let both scalars extend indefinitely, you can reach every point on the plane.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img12.svg" alt="Scalars ranging freely span the full plane" />
        <p class="image-caption">Letting both scalars run freely reaches every point on the plane</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        However, if your two original vectors happen to line up, the lines produced by the scalar multiplication will be the same line, so adding them together can't yield a vector outside of that line.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img13.svg" alt="Collinear vectors only span a line" />
        <p class="image-caption">Collinear vectors are stuck on the same line</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        There's a third possibility too: both your vectors could be the $\mathbf{0}$ vector, in which case you'll just be stuck at the origin.
      </p>

      <!-- SECTION: Span -->
      <h2>Span</h2>

      <p>
        The set of all possible vectors you can reach with linear combinations of a given pair of vectors is called the <span class="highlight">span</span> of those two vectors. The span of most pairs of 2D vectors is all of 2D space. <span class="highlight">When they line up, the span collapses to a single line.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$\text{span}(\vec{\mathbf{v}}, \vec{\mathbf{w}}) = \{a\vec{\mathbf{v}} + b\vec{\mathbf{w}} \mid a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$$
      </div>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img14.svg" alt="Span of a linear combination" />
        <p class="image-caption">The span is all vectors reachable by linear combinations</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Vectors vs Points -->
      <h2>Vectors vs Points</h2>

      <p>
        When you're thinking about a single vector, it's best to think of it as an arrow, but what about multiple vectors? When you're dealing with a whole collection of vectors (say, every vector whose tip sits on a line), <span class="highlight">it's easier to just think about their endpoints.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img15.png" alt="A vector as an arrow" />
        <p class="image-caption">A single vector as an arrow</p>
      </div>

        <p class="image-caption">All 2D vectors conceptualized as points filling the plane</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Span in 3D -->
      <h2>Span in 3D</h2>

      <p>
        The idea of span gets more interesting if we start thinking about vectors in three-dimensional space. For example, if you take two vectors in 3D that are not pointing in the same direction, what does it mean to take their span?
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img18.svg" alt="Two vectors in 3D space" />
        <p class="image-caption">Two vectors in three-dimensional space</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Same idea as before: scale each one, add them, and see what you can reach.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img19.svg" alt="Linear combination in 3D" />
        <p class="image-caption">A linear combination of two 3D vectors</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Imagine turning two knobs, one for each scalar. As you adjust them, <span class="highlight">the tip of the resulting vector traces out a flat sheet through the origin.</span> That sheet is the span of the two vectors.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img20.svg" alt="Span of two 3D vectors forms a plane" />
        <p class="image-caption">The span of two non-collinear 3D vectors is a plane through the origin</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Adding a Third Vector</h3>

      <p>
        What happens if we throw in a third vector? Same deal: three scalars, three vectors, one sum:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        $$a\vec{\mathbf{v}} + b\vec{\mathbf{w}} + c\vec{\mathbf{u}}$$
      </div>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img21.svg" alt="Linear combination of three vectors" />
        <p class="image-caption">The linear combination of $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$, $\vec{\mathbf{w}}$, and $\vec{\mathbf{u}}$</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Two things can happen when we add a third vector:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Case 1:</strong> If the third vector already sits on the span of the first two, the span doesn't change. You're trapped on that same flat sheet, with no new reach.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img22.svg" alt="Third vector lies in span of first two" />
        <p class="image-caption">Third vector already in the span, no new reach</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Case 2:</strong> If the third vector is <em>not</em> in the span of the first two, it points in a genuinely new direction — and <span class="highlight">now you can reach every vector in 3D space.</span> Scaling it sweeps that flat sheet through all of space.
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img23.svg" alt="Third vector is not in span, unlocking full 3D" />
        <p class="image-caption">A third independent vector unlocks all of 3D space</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Linear Dependence and Independence</h3>

      <p>
        When a vector is already in the span of the others (whether it's a third vector sitting on a plane or two vectors along the same line), it's redundant. Whenever you can remove a vector without shrinking the span, the set is <span class="highlight">linearly dependent.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img24.svg" alt="Linearly dependent vectors in 2D" />
        <p class="image-caption">Linearly dependent: one vector is redundant</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Put differently: <span class="highlight">one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img25.svg" alt="Linearly dependent vectors in 3D" />
        <p class="image-caption">A dependent vector lies in the span of the others</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        On the other hand, if each vector truly does add another dimension to the span, they are said to be <span class="highlight">linearly independent.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/img26.svg" alt="Linearly independent vectors in 3D" />
        <p class="image-caption">Each independent vector adds a new dimension to the span</p>
      </div>
